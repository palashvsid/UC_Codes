##Introducing Myself
![](C:\Users\palas_000\Desktop\dp1.jpg)
<p font-size="8">
* I hail from a coal-mining town in Central India. 
* Having completed my Civil Enginnering bachelors from BITS-Pilani, I started working in the field of Analytics to get away from Civil Engineering! 
* Over my 2 years of professional experience, I worked for clients such as Paypal and Unilever on Marketing Analytics, customer acquistion funnel reporting and retail sales optimization. 

* I have worked R as the primary method of programming in these 2 years along with SQL, Excel and QGIS (spatial analytics). 
* After completing my masters, I plan to work as a Data Scientist in retail or technology domains and _hopefully be an entrepreneur one day_.
